# Personal porfolio website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator, and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## Credits
Inspired by existing templates in the showcase section of [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/showcase). 

In particular, the website builds upon the layout and code of projects, communities and about pages provided by [Evan Tay](https://evantay.com/). The landing page is adapted from [TinaÃ«l Devresse's personal website](https://tinaeldevresse.eu/).
